===========================

Batch compound

With this module it is possible to add compound items in batch.
Go to the URL https://[islandora-server]/ubl_batch_compound and upload a CSV file. This file contains two columns. The values of the first column are used to search for potential parent items. If none of more than one item is found, a new parent will be generated. The values in the second column are used to find the child items.
Once the CSV file is uploaded, a list of potential compound items is displayed, so a review is possible before making these changes. Items that are mistakenly found, can be deselected.
After the review the compound items can be made. Then the changes can be reviewed by clicking on the link to the parent items.
